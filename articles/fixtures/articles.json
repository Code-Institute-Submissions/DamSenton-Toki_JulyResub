            "intro": "Take a deep dive into the mind of Darya Ginger. \r\nWith her traditional chinese designs, Darya blends modern and classic techniques to achieve perfection in every piece. Darya has made a name for herself in the world of pottery over the past decade - and it’s certainly not without merit!",
            "article_content": "When I was a young girl, my mother took me to a craft fair. It was there I saw antiques of all shapes and sizes and fell in love. This ignited a long life obsession with the arts - pottery in particular.\r\n\r\nIn my twenties I took a course in pottery and took to it like a duck to water. I quickly learnt techniques to help me achieve more and more technically challenging and complex designs. Over the years, I honed these technical skills but it wasn’t until I visited China that I truly found my niche. The bold lines, porcelain faces of sculptures and beautifully intricate patterns followed me home and found its way into my work where it has stayed ever since. \r\n\r\nI love working with a variety of materials, each bringing a different feel to the piece of work I have created. I love traditional clay and earthenware, but also of course have a passion for working with porcelain which adds a certain authenticity to my pieces which are done in a traditional Chinese style. Not so long ago, I released a collection of Chinese porcelain pieces composed of the traditional kaolin clay.\r\n\r\nI feel so fortunate to have carved a career over the past decade of my life doing something I am so passionate about. I hope to continue in the wonderful world of pottery for many years to come working with all sorts of independent businesses and talented individuals."

            "intro": "One of pottery's elites, ORIENTO, shows us that skill and experience go hand in hand. ORIENTO creates incredible pieces of Raku pottery which are created using traiditional Japanese firing - this method requires expertise and is certainly not for the faint hearted. Every piece created is individual in nature with beautiful colours and designs. ORIENTO has earned his reputation in pottery.",
            "article_content": "I have been obsessed with the technical processes in pottery ever since I can remember and have managed to develop skill in using these technical processes over the course of my life. I was never one for academics and I took an apprenticeship at the age of 15 and never looked back - I feel so fortunate now when I look at the opportunity I was given.\r\n\r\nI learned raku very quickly and have implemented it into all of my designs during the course of my career. Raku firing is one of the most natural techniques in pottery which uses all of the elements to create the most beautiful and intricate effects and colours - each piece comes out with its own sense of individuality. The art created is simply unmatched for me, I feel like you can't beat it.\r\n\r\nRaku dates back to the early 1550s and there is something special about it - it is one of those rare methods that has lasted the test of time. Raku pottery is a passion for me and I truly believe that I would be lost without it. I have been so fortunate in that I have had my work show cased in different exhibitions worldwide. Long may it continue!"

            "article_content": "In my first year of university I saw an art installation which showcased pottery and ceramics. I fell in love and knew I had to give it a go myself. As an art student, the different forms and the use of colour on different materials was really stunning. This is were I drew my inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe art community as a whole - in pottery and in other art mediums - can feel elitist and inaccessible for people. I have set out to create pieces which can be appreciated for the art that they are, but also feel as if they don’t harbour any pretence. I am drawn towards strong designs with bold lines which is exactly what each piece from my debut collection shows. I have used monochromatic colour schemes with straight lines and have used a traditional throwing method with simple materials. \r\n\r\nI believe art is for everyone to enjoy and it is my mission to make that a reality with my ceramics. You will see more from me, watch out!"

            "article_content": "I truly believe that when done simply, pottery can create the most incredible and striking results. I like to create clean simple lines when I throw my pieces and don’t like to over complicate the designs, creating a modern and edgy style. \r\n\r\nAs well as creating statement pieces, functionality is also something I enjoy. The technicalities of making a piece that not only looks great but can be utilised is a thrill. I love to incorporate ombré colour gradients, which I generally do on the underglaze before creating my finished polished piece. I use traditionally made glazes (as I have done my whole career so far), which perfectly balance the main three ingredients silica, alumina and flux. \r\n\r\nNothing I make is perfect.. and why should it be? Pottery is a form of expression for me, and I'm so grateful that I get to express myself and have so many people enjoy it. I want to go down in pottery history as one of the ceramic artists who have given pottery an update!"
